## Overview

In this lesson, I learn the basic concepts and methods of logistic regression specially designed for geographical data. Upon completion of this lesson, you will able to:

-   explain the similarities and differences between Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm versus geographical weighted Logistic Regression (GWLR) algorithm.

-   calibrate predictive models by using appropriate Geographically Weighted Logistic Regression algorithm for geographical data.
