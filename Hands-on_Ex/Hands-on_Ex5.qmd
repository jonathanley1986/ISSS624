## Overview

In this lesson, I learnt the basic concepts and methods of machine learning techniques specially designed for geographical data. Upon completion of this lesson, you will able to:

-   explain the similarities and differences between non-spatial Random Forest (RF) algorithm versus geographical weighted RF algorithm.

-   calibrate predictive models by using appropriate geographically weighted RF algorithm for geographical data.
