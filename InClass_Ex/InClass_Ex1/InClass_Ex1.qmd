Getting Started (Load Code)

The code chunk below will install and load tidyverse and sf packages.

Note: Specify package name in the code chunk if it is not loaded in the library.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, spdep)
```

Importing Geospatial Data

Importing polygon features

This code chunk below will import ESRI stepfile into R.

```{r}
mpsz <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "MP14_SUBZONE_WEB_PL")
```

Importing and transforming projected coordinates system

Note: For SG coordinates, you need to transform to CRS = 3414

```{r}
preschool = st_read("data/geospatial/pre-schools-location-kml.kml") %>%
  st_transform(crs = 3414)
```

```{r}
hunan <- st_read(dsn = "data/geospatial", layer = "Hunan")
```

```{r}
hunan <- read_csv("data/aspatial/Hunan_2012.csv")

```
